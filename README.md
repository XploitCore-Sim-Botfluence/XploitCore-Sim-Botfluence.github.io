# XploitCore‑Sim

**Advanced Cybersecurity Simulation & Training Framework**

XploitCore‑Sim is a fully modular, non-operational training environment designed to help users understand security concepts, attack flow simulations, and defensive best‑practices.  
No real exploitation occurs. All modules are educational and operate in a closed simulation environment.
